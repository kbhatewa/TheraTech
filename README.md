# TheraTech – Emotion-Aware Mental Health Chatbot 💬🧠

TheraTech is an AI-powered mental health web application that uses real-time facial emotion recognition to deliver personalized therapeutic support. Developed during the 2025 Pearl Hacks hackathon, TheraTech combines computer vision and empathetic chatbot technology to help users manage stress, anxiety, and other emotional states through guided support.

## 💡 Inspiration

After attending an introductory computer vision workshop at Pearl Hacks, we were inspired by the idea of detecting facial expressions through a webcam. It sparked the thought: what if technology could do more than detect emotions—what if it could help people manage them? This led to the creation of **TheraTech**, where AI meets empathy to support emotional well-being.
